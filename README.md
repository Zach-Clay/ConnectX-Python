# ConnectX-Python
Displays Software Development Principles

I completed this fun project in order to gain experience with Python. It is
a very popular programming language that I have not learned in my CS curriculum
at Clemson University, so I took matters into my own hands to get familiar with
the language.

It is pretty simple for now. The game is controlled from GameApp.py where the
main method lives. I used the template hook design pattern by creating the
abstract class, AbsGameBoard, however, it currently only has one implementation.
I plan to later use an implementation using a dictionary for memory efficiency.

I also plan to develop a GUI for this project. I have not decided which Framework
I will use yet.

NOTE: As you can see from other repositories of mine, I first made this project
in my Software Development class and it was originally coded in Java. I chose
to use the same principles from that project and code it in Python simply to gain
familiarity with the language and learn the similarities/differences.
